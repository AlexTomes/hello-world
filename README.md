# Intro
This originated in the GitHub tutorial.  Consider it a cover page of sorts. 

Anyways, I'm Alex Tomes. I'm a CS/Business student at the University of Puget Sound.  I get excited about Machine Learning, Big Data, Cloud computing, and AI.  I'm eager to develop my skills to the point where I am capable of working on the biggest problems in Computer Science.  So far I have experience with Java, Ruby on Rails, CSS, SQLite and AWS instances.
